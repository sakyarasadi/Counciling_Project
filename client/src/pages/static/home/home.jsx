                Counselling is a process of helping someone to deal with emotional
                issues by listening, questioning, and reflecting. Talking therapy
                allows people to discuss their problems with trained professionals
                in a peaceful and safe ambiance. The role of a counselor doesnâ€™t
                limit to suggesting you do this or that. Rather they support you
                to speak about your problems in detail to identify the primary
                cause behind them. Furthermore, they develop an action plan to
                help you cope up with the issue or win over it.

                The counselling process involves a step-by-step approach, and the counselor
                conducts it in a way to make sure that the client is comfortable with
                the process.
